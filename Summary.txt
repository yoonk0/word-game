Summary 
Project Introduction
The project is intended to help the kids under 12 to remember the vocabulary needed for school and daily life. The user chooses the lessons to learn, each with 20 words of specific topic. He/She can also add the words to the review list and delete them out after the review. Every word is stored in a learning card form, including the image and pronunciation audio of the word. It is also an entertaining program that the kids can play the word game. The user can instruct the car’s movement to collect the coins and will be stopped by the obstacles on road, which will post word questions for the user. He/She can get the points if he/she answers the questions correctly. It is a kid-friendly learning tool involving both learning and playing.
